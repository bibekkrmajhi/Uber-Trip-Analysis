### 📊 Dataset Information

Dataset: Uber TLC FOIL Response Dataset (2014)

Download Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18NQlkW0fl3rEkj8M5uZ_W7Kbg5axecIN?usp=sharing

Contains:

- Date/Time

- Latitude

- Longitude

- Base

Covers April to September 2014 with over 4.5 million trip records.

### 🔎 Project Workflow

#### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Merged multiple monthly CSV files

- Converted Date/Time to datetime format

- Checked for missing values and duplicates

- Created time-based features:

     - Hour

     - Day

     - Month

     - DayOfWeek

     - Lag_1

     - Lag_24

#### 2️⃣ SQL Analytics (DuckDB)

Performed aggregation queries:

- Total trips

- Trips per hour

- Trips per day of week

- Monthly growth trend

- Base performance

- Daily trip trend

#### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Created visualizations:

- Trips per Hour

- Trips per Day

- Monthly Trend

- Hour vs Day Heatmap

- Hourly Time Series

- 24-Hour Rolling Average

- Pickup Location Map

#### 4️⃣ Time Series Analysis

- Converted trips into hourly time series

- Applied seasonal decomposition

- Identified:

     - Trend component

     - Daily seasonality

     - Residual variation

#### 5️⃣ Predictive Modeling

Model Used:

- Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- R² Score

Lag features significantly improved model accuracy.

### 📈 Key Insights

- Peak demand occurs between 5 PM – 9 PM

- Weekend trips are higher than weekdays

- Strong daily seasonality detected

- Trip volume increased from April to September

- Manhattan region shows highest pickup concentration

- Lag features improve forecasting performance

### 💼 Business Recommendations

- Increase driver allocation during peak evening hours

- Implement surge pricing during predictable high-demand periods

- Optimize fleet distribution based on demand heatmaps

- Use forecasting model for driver scheduling optimization

 ### 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize Uber trip demand patterns, including peak hours, weekday trends, and monthly growth.

The dashboard provides key insights through KPI metrics, hourly demand analysis, heatmaps, and trend visualizations.
